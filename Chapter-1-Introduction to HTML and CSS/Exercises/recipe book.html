    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
            <li>Milk powder - it is important to use a good quality whole milk powder for best results. I have always used Nido and found it to be the best for this recipe!</li>
            <li>All purpose flour</li>
            <li>Baking powder</li>
            <li>Egg - now, I know egg isn't used in many gulab jamun recipes, especially in India. And if you don't consume egg, you can replace it with a similar volume in milk (about 3-4 tbsp). The reason why I use egg in this recipe is it adds structure to the gulab jamun and prevents them from absorbing too much oil when fried.</li>
            <li>Heavy cream or fresh cream</li>
            <li>Ghee or clarified butter</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Cardamom pods</li>
            <li>Oil for frying</li>

    <h2>Instructions for preparing and serving Gulab-jamun</h2>
<li>MAKE THE DOUGH
    You will mix together the wet and dry ingredients separately and then add them to each other to form a dough. Knead it with clean hands for 1-2 minutes. It will feel quite soft and oily, don't worry. Refrigerate the dough for 20 minutes, and then knead it again for a few minutes until it feels smooth and soft, and has no lumps in it.</li>
<li>FORM BALLS
    Now you will divide the dough into 20g balls - this recipe should make 12 gulab jamun. These are quite small, about the size of a large grape.This step is quite important to get right: you need to make sure the balls are perfectly rolled and don't have any cracks in them. If the balls have cracks, the gulab jamun will fall apart during frying.</li>
<li>FRY THE GULAB JAMUN
    Fry the gulab jamun in two to three parts depending on the size of the wok. Carefully drop them into the oil, and then gently roll them around while frying so then brown evenly on all sides.</li>
<li>MAKE THE SUGAR SYRUP
    While you are frying the gulab jamun, start making the syrup in another pot or saucepan. Mix all the ingredients and simmer on medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Then turn off the heat.</li>
<li>SOAK THE GULAB JAMUN
    Transfer the fried gulab jamun to the syrup. Swirl the pot to coat the gulab jamun on all sides, then cover and let sit for a minimum of 30 minutes. This is when the gulab jamun will soak in the syrup, become larger in size, and soft and squishy inside!</li>
<li>SERVE & ENJOY!
    These are best when still warm!</li>
